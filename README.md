# MeleeMusicSync
While Melee custom music is available through ROM hacks (such as 20XX hack pack), this form of custom music is not entirely compatible with Netplay and will cause desyncs. This project aims to use an existing trainer, [DolphinTrainer](https://github.com/thefinalstarman/DolphinTrainer),for Melee in order to detect the current stage and play custom music, outside of the game.
